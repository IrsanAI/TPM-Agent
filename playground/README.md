# TPM Playground (MVP)

A lightweight browser playground to explore TPM concepts interactively:
- single-agent weak-signal anomaly detection
- mini swarm consensus pressure
- cross-domain transfer resonance (synthetic)

## Run locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8765
# open http://localhost:8765/playground/index.html
```

## Scope

This is a simulation and onboarding UI, not production trading execution.
